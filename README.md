This study explored the application of MultiTask Learning (MTL) in the domain of song genre classification. Two hard parameter sharing architectures based on CNN and BERT models were employed for this purpose. Further, both architectures were trained with a range of auxiliary tasks concerning song characteristics such as romance, violence, and sadness to assess the impact of their addition on the target task of genre classification. It was observed that the predictive performance of the
individual genres changed disparately depending on the auxiliary tasks introduced. In sum,
the introduction of auxiliary tasks improved
the performance of the CNN-MTL architecture
while having negligible impact on the BERTMTL architecture.
